# Project: Energy optimization analysis - Python application with Tkinter

This is a Python application with a graphical interface developed with Tkinter that allows the analysis of residential energy consumption. It offers consumption analysis, alerts and optimization options based on a home's energy consumption data.

## Concept description

The application uses a home's energy consumption database to offer consumption analysis, alerts and optimization options.

## Function

The aim is for the application to perform the following functions:

- Allow the user to feed the application with new electricity bill data and complement previous data to improve analysis;
- Enable the user to see the data that is already in the system, sorting by date, consumption, filtering by year, among others;
- With the current month's consumption, offer an alert if consumption has increased in relation to the previous month (indicating possible problems with equipment if it increases significantly outside the standard);
- Offer an explanation and introduction on how to implement photovoltaic panels in the home, providing data on the number of panels, estimated cost, projected return time, among others.

## Motivation

The application's motivation is to optimize household consumption. In the short term, to reduce consumption and/or identify possible equipment problems more quickly. In the medium term, we have the implementation of renewable energy, which will help consumers save money. In the long term, we will reduce the natural impacts generated by optimizing consumption and using renewable energy.


## How to Use the Application

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python installed on your desktop. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The application was developed and tested using Python 3.

### Running the Application

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

2. Navigate to the folder where the application files are located.

3. Open a command terminal or command prompt in the application folder.

4. Run the following command to launch the application: python EnergyTracker.py

### Application Screens

1. Home Screen: where data from your past accounts can be added

### Installing dependencies for compilation
The requirements.txt file included the necessary libraries to run the file's script. To install them, simply do the following procedure:

+ Step 1:
Go to the command prompt with the shortcut Windows+R and type "cmd", then press the enter key to open the Windows terminal.
+ Step 2:
Navigate using the cd command to the directory where requirements.txt is on your computer.
+ Step 3:
Finally install all dependencies with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
